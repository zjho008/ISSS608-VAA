This makes it an useful alternative to the histogram for continuous data that comes from a smooth distribution.\nThe code below plots the distribution of Maths scores in a kernel density estimate plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data,\n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\nUsing colour/fill arguments in aes(), the following can be plotted\n\nggplot(data=exam_data,\n       aes(x = MATHS,\n           colour = GENDER)) +\n  geom_density(linewidth = 1.5)\n\n\n\n\nNote that linewidth argument was utilised within the geom_density() function to increase thickness of line.\n\n\n4.3.7 Geometric Objects: geom_boxplot()\ngeom_boxplot() displays continuous value list. It visualises five summary statistics (the median, two hinges and two whiskers), and all “outlying” points individually.\nThe code chunk below plots boxplots by using geom_boxplot().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\nNotches are used in box plots to help visually assess whether the medians of distributions differ. If the notches do not overlap, this is evidence that the medians are different.\nThe following code chunk uses notched plot instead of boxplot to plot the distribution of Maths scores by gender.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.8 Geometric Objects: geom_violin()\ngeom_violin is designed for creating violin plot. Violin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions.\nWhen ordinary density curves are plotted, there tends to be difficulty in comparinf multiple distributions since the lines usually interfere with one another.\nWith the violin plot, comparing several distributions will be easier since they are beside each other.\nThe code below plot the distribution of Maths score by gender in violin plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.9 Geometric Objects: geom_point()\ngeom_point() is especially useful for creating scatterplots.\nThe code chunk below plots a scatterplot showing the Maths and English grades of pupils by using geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data,\n       aes(x= MATHS,\n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.10 geom objects can be combined\nThe code chunk below plots the data points on the boxplots by using both geom_boxplot() and geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +     \n  geom_point(position=\"jitter\",\n             size = 0.5)"

In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package.

    "text": "9.3 Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot\nRidgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n\n\nRidgelines plot: English score by class\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise groups will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\n\n9.3.1 Plotting ridgeline graph: ggridges method\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH,\n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    colour = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English Grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n  ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3.2 Varying fill colors along the x axis\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = ENGLISH,\n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp.

    "text": "9.4 Visualising Distribution with Raincloud Plot\nRaincloud Plot is a data visualisation technique that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, we will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n9.4.1 Plotting a Half Eye graph\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = RACE,\n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.2 Adding the boxplot with geom_boxplot()\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = RACE,\n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.3 Adding the Dot Plots with stat_dots()\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = “left” to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = RACE,\n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\",\n            justification = 1.2,\n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.4.4 Finishing touch\nLastly, coord_flip() of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance. At the same time, theme_economist() of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.\n\nThe plotThe code chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam,\n       aes(x = RACE,\n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\",\n            justification = 1.2,\n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 1.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_economist()"
