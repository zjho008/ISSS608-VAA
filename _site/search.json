    "text": "4.3 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: geom\n\nGeometric objects are the actual marks we put on a plot. Examples include:\ngeom_point for drawing individual points (e.g., a scatter plot)\ngeom_line for drawing lines (e.g., for a line charts)\ngeom_smooth for drawing smoothed lines (e.g., for simple trends or approximations)\ngeom_bar for drawing bars (e.g., for bar charts)\ngeom_histogram for drawing binned values (e.g. a histogram)\ngeom_polygon for drawing arbitrary shapes geom_map for drawing polygons in the shape of a map! (You can access the data to use for these maps by using the map_data() function).\n\n\n\nA plot must have at least one geom; there is no upper limit. You can add a geom to a plot using the + operator.\nFor complete list, please refer to here.\n\n\n4.3.1 Geometric Objects: geom_bar\nThe code chunk below plots a bar chart byy using the geom_bar() function.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Geometric Objects: geom_dotplot\nIn a dot plot, the width of a dot corresponds to the bin width (or maximum width, depending on the binning algorithm), and dots are stacked, with each dot representing one observation.\nIn the code chunk below, geom_dotplot() of ggplot2 is used to plot a dot plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5)\n\nBin width defaults to 1/30 of the range of the data. Pick better value with\n`binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nDo note that the Y Scale might not be useful and in fact misleading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below will perform the following two steps:\n\nscale_y_continuous() is used to turn off the y-axis, and\nbinwidth argument is used to change the binwidth to 2.5.\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(binwidth=2.5,         \n               dotsize = 0.5) +      \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,           \n                     breaks = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Geometric Objects: geom_histogram()\nIn the code chunk below, geom_histogram() is used to create a simple histogram by using values in MATHS field of exam_data.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data,\n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`.

This makes it an useful alternative to the histogram for continuous data that comes from a smooth distribution.\nThe code below plots the distribution of Maths scores in a kernel density estimate plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data,\n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\nUsing colour/fill arguments in aes(), the following can be plotted\n\nggplot(data=exam_data,\n       aes(x = MATHS,\n           colour = GENDER)) +\n  geom_density(linewidth = 1.5)\n\n\n\n\nNote that linewidth argument was utilised within the geom_density() function to increase thickness of line.\n\n\n4.3.7 Geometric Objects: geom_boxplot()\ngeom_boxplot() displays continuous value list. It visualises five summary statistics (the median, two hinges and two whiskers), and all “outlying” points individually.\nThe code chunk below plots boxplots by using geom_boxplot().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\nNotches are used in box plots to help visually assess whether the medians of distributions differ. If the notches do not overlap, this is evidence that the medians are different.\nThe following code chunk uses notched plot instead of boxplot to plot the distribution of Maths scores by gender.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.8 Geometric Objects: geom_violin()\ngeom_violin is designed for creating violin plot. Violin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions.\nWhen ordinary density curves are plotted, there tends to be difficulty in comparinf multiple distributions since the lines usually interfere with one another.\nWith the violin plot, comparing several distributions will be easier since they are beside each other.\nThe code below plot the distribution of Maths score by gender in violin plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.9 Geometric Objects: geom_point()\ngeom_point() is especially useful for creating scatterplots.\nThe code chunk below plots a scatterplot showing the Maths and English grades of pupils by using geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data,\n       aes(x= MATHS,\n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.10 geom objects can be combined\nThe code chunk below plots the data points on the boxplots by using both geom_boxplot() and geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data,\n       aes(y = MATHS,\n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +     \n  geom_point(position=\"jitter\",\n             size = 0.5)"

    "text": "Singapore’s residential property market is branched into two primary sectors: public and private housing.Public housing, which is subsidized by the government, primarily caters to the essential housing needs of the general populace, specifically for households with a monthly income of S$14,000 or less. In contrast, households earning more than this income threshold generally turn to the private residential market. Moreover, given Singapore’s limited land area with it being one of the smallest countries in the world, real estate remains perpetually high in demand. This tends to bring about challenges due to the competitive nature of securing housing in either the public or private residential market."
