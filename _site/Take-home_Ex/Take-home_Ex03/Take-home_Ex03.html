<p>Oceanus has a dynamic business landscape with frequent startups, mergers, acquisitions and investments. FishEye International, a non-profit organization that focuses on illegal fishing monitors commercial fishing operators to prevent illegal fishing in the region’s sensitive marine ecosystem. Analysts use a hybrid automated/manual process to transform company records into CatchNet: the Oceanus Knowledge Graph.</p>
<p>Last year, SouthSeafood Express Corp was caught fishing illegally, disrupting the commercial fishing sector. FishEye aims to analyse the temporal patterns and impacts of this incident on the fishing market. The competitive nature of the market might lead some businesses attempting to seize SouthSeafood’s market share, while others may recognize the consequences of illegal fishing.</p>

<h2 data-number="2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="project-objectives"><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Project Objectives</h2>
<p>The project will focus on 2 out of the 4 tasks (<strong>Questions 3 and 4</strong>) from VAST Challenge 2024: <a href="https://vast-challenge.github.io/2024/MC3.html">Mini-Challenge 3</a></p>
<p>This project aims to develop visualisation tools that work with CatchNet to identify the people who hold influence over business networks and hold those who own nefarious companies accountable. That is especially difficult with varied and changing shareholder and ownership relationships. The tasks are:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><strong>Develop a visual approach to examine inferences</strong>. Infer how the influence of a company changes through time. Can we infer ownership or influence that a network may have?</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><strong>Identify the network associated with SouthSeafood Express Corp</strong> and visualize how this network and competing businesses change as a result of their illegal fishing behavior. Which companies <u>benefited from SouthSeafood Express Corp legal troubles</u>? Are there <u>other suspicious transactions</u> that may be related to illegal fishing? Providing visual evidence for the conclusions.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Note: the VAST challenge is focused on visual analytics and graphical figures should be included with your response to each question. Please include a reasonable number of figures for each question (no more than about 6) and keep written responses as brief as possible (around 250 words per question). Participants are encouraged to new visual representations rather than relying on traditional or existing approaches.</p>

<p>For these questions, we would have to investigate the changes through time in multiple areas mainly:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Individual’s ownership and influence on a network for the first portion</li>
<li>Following which, how the networks and companies changes as a result of the SouthSeafood Express Corp incident.</li>
</ol>
<p>To achieve this we will attempt to create visualisations of network graphs and carrying out faceting to allow us to observe for patterns and trends and make our inferences.</p>

<p>From the table above, the date data type and inappropriate field name issues as faced earlier are also present:</p>
<ul>
<li>columns with date data type are not in the correct format</li>
<li>some field names(for e.g <code>_last_edited_by</code>, <code>_date_added</code>) start with “_” and will have to be renamed to avoid unnecessary coding issues in the later part of the tasks.</li>
